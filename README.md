# Weather and News App
![](https://github.com/dantemoon1/205final/blob/main/preview.png)
This app was created for a user to be able to grab weather and top trending news articles by searching with a city name.
It utilizes Python Flask as well as a responsive bootstrap-flask framework, and is powered by the Openweather and GNews API.
[OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
[GNews API](https://gnews.io/)
To make it easier for the end user to run the app, we linked the github repo to heroku cloud and deployed it live (hosted on Heroku's free tier).
